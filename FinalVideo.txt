Although the FinalVideo.mp4 was able to be submitted to Blackboard properly,
the file was too large to upload to Github. The link above can be used to view the video
via Google Drive. I can try editing the video down to reduce file size, but that will
take time and it won't be able to be done today (29 april 2020) if I'm to be able to
pay attention to the final EC544 course lecture and then also complete Lab4 in time.
